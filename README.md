FreeFactory
===========
==UPDATE 2025-06-15==
FreeFactory has a new repository and this one will see no more updates. The new repository is located here:
https://github.com/lacojim/FreeFactoryQT

This version is now the only supported version replacing both this version and my original version @ https://github.com/Lexridge/freefactory


==UPDATE 2025-06-11==
FreeFactory is in the process of being re-written in Python3 using QT for the frontend (Factory builder) and now uses systemd for the notify service. This removes the line from rc.local (which is already deprecated on many Linux OSes). Also, could much more easily support Windows in the future. It supports direct drag and drop encoding now as well for those who don't need a full regiment of broadcast compatible watched folders (ie notify daemon no longer necessary for casual users).
